This repository contains some of the most useful algorithms and techniques.

I found these "worth storing" on my GitHub page. 

I hope to keep updating this as I encounter more helpful techniques.

- addition to suffix-array.cpp, perform substring string
  
  - since the suffixes are sorted, we will binary search on which position matches our string

  - time complexity : O(logN |P|) ; P is the input string
